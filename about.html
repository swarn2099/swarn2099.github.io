          Mrs. Elizabeth Davis ... I am a member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 1988 and a Magna Cum Laude graduate with a B.S. in Curriculum and Instruction - English Composite teaching certification.  After teaching senior English, on-level and Advanced Placement, and sponsoring the yearbook for fifteen years at A & M Consolidated High School, my family moved to Austin twelve years ago.  I have enjoyed teaching junior on-level, junior Advanced Placement and senior Advanced Placement English at Westwood.  This will begin my 13th year as a Warrior.  Once again this year, I will be teaching my dream schedule, both AP English Language and Composition (AP English III) and AP Literature and Composition (AP English IV).<br><hr color="white">

                In my 27-year career, a number of incredible experiences  have shaped my teaching skills and practices, including teaching Saturday student sessions for SAT and AP and even working with the Texas A & M Medical School teaching MCAT prep in a summer program.  In addition, for almost 20 years, I have been lucky enough to serve as a consultant for The College Board, teaching conferences, leading summer institutes, presenting student prep sessions, and mentoring teachers.  Every workshop I present resonates in my own classroom as I gain knowledge and skills from networking with other teachers and developing new methods and ideas.<br><hr color="white">

                When I am not grading papers, I love spending time with my family, husband Mickey (Mineral and Gas appraiser for Capital Appraisal Group), son Josh (Graduate student at the University of Oklahoma), daughter-in-law Kaitlyn (professional counselor), son Nick  and future daughter-in-law Hannah (seniors at Texas A & M University).  I sing soprano in my church choir and am involved in the women's ministry on occasion.  For the last few years, I have completely spoiled my "empty nest" puppy named "Aggie May"  and my old dog "Buster."<br><hr color="white">

    These are a few of my favorite things...<br><hr color="white">

    MUSIC ... I love everything from opera to hip hop.  My favorite singer of all time is Sandy Patti (whom I got to meet this year).  Most recently, I find myself completely obsessed with all things  Hamilton.<br><hr color="white">

    BOOKS... Where the Red Fern Grows,  Jane Eyre, anything by Shakespeare, The Poisonwood Bible, A Thousand Splendid Suns, The Book Thief, Death of a Salesman, and all the Harry Potter books (favorite character - Molly Weasley).<br><hr color="white">

    MOVIES... I'll watch them over and over and memorize the lines (It's a Wonderful Life, Gone with the Wind, Rocky, The Sure Thing, Saturday Night Fever, The Shawshank Redemption, Cold Mountain, My Cousin Vinny, When Harry Met Sally, All the Harry Potter movies, and I'll go see just about anything new...)<br><hr color="white">
